Farmer's Weather System

Introduction:
This system helps the farmer's to know the weather condition for the next two days on there feature phone and via call service in their native language.
We used tkinter library(Python) for the GUI.
We used mysql database to store farmer's data and manipulate it for sending them messages on regular basis.
For accessing weather for next two days, used waeather api from https://openweathermap.org/api.
For converting message from english to hindi used google's api 'googletrans'.
For converting messege into audio file for sending audio message used google api 'gtts'.
For sending messages to farmer's used Twilio message service.
